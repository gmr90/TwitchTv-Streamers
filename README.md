Twitch users current streamings


1.User Story: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

2.User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

3.User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

4.User Story: I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.
